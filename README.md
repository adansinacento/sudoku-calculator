# Sudoku Calculator

[Link to the application](https://adansinacento.github.io/sudoku-calculator/)

A simple tool I made to dynamically calculate sums for killer sudoku or sandwitch sudoku.

It can calculate every sum combination for numbers [1 - 45] and you can tweak which digits you want to include in the combinations (and which ones not) and also the number of digits that conform the addition.

## How to run dev environment:

- Make sure you have installed _Node v18.13.0_
- run `npm install` on root folder (only once, not required to run every time)
- run `ng serve` and open http://localhost:4200/ in your browser

To make a build run `ng build`, the compiled files will be in the /dist folder on root.
