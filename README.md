# Sudoku Calculator

[Link to the application](https://adansinacento.github.io/sudoku-calculator/)

A simple tool I made to dynamically calculate sums for killer sudoku or sandwitch sudoku.

It can calculate every sum combination for numbers [1 - 45] and you can tweak which digits you want to include in the combinations (and which ones not) and also the number of digits that conform the addition.
